### __Planning:__ 

thinking about the deadline of 7 days and the scope of tasks, I organized the tasks as follows:
  
<br />

> 1 day for planning, describe api routes, design basic frontend layout.

> 3 days to develop the API sorting the requirements by priority.

    API priorities:
      1. implement at least one route using TDD (/register)
      2. implement login and register routes
      3. implement the rest of the routes if time remains

> 3 days to develop the frontend also separating requirements by priorities.

    priorities:
      1. implement the pages referring to the developed API routes
      2. if you have time, develop other features without API interaction
